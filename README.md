# SOCharts
This library is a wrapper around the [echarts](https://echarts.apache.org) JavaScript
library for using it with [Vaadin 8](https://vaadin.com). The charts can be used
just like any other Vaadin components.

This library is a fork version of SOCharts(https://github.com/syampillai/SOCharts), 
fantastic job from Syam Pillai, which is originally developed for vaadin 10+ flow framework.
